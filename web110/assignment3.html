        Session 3 - Internet Fundamentals - Search Engines
        Activity 1: Compare Search Engines
        Going through the four specific search engines listed, and playing around with them so I could get a good idea on how they operate. I am more used to using google 
        regularly, but it was a good change to be able to test out various other search engines. I would have to say that google is still my favorite search engine to use and 
        will still be my go to search engine. I did like using the Yahoo search engine because of the interface, it looked so nice and fresh to me. If I were to switch from 
        google, then I would definitely stick with Yahoo as a good alternative search engine. I did not like the interfaces of Ask or Bing so I would not use those anytime in 
        the future.

        Activity 2: Use Search Engines
        Using my preferred search engine, I searched for the specific phrase asked to be searched with and without quotes to determine if the results were more accurate with or 
        without them. After doing both searches, I have concluded that I got the same results with both searches, and nothing was different about them. After doing the second 
        part of searching specific phrases from my search engine and Wikiversityâ€™s built in search engine, I would have to say my search engine still had the more accurate 
        results. Using my search engine to search the final phrase, I would have to say it explained what SEO stands for, and had numerous websites explaining it in more depth.
