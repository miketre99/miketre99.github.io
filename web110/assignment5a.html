        Session 5a - Internet Fundamentals - Social Media
        Activity 1: TutorialsPoint: Social Networking
        After downloading all the listed social media applications, I decided to play around with the apps I wasn’t familiar with so I could get a good grasp of how the app 
        worked and what it was about. The social media applications that interest me the most from the list would have to be Twitter and WhatsApp since I do use them daily. The 
        apps I have not used before but would be interested in would be Flickr and Ibibo, so I can try something new. After going through all the social media applications and 
        getting a rough idea of them, I would have to say the only applications I see myself using would be Twitter and WhatsApp. I don’t find myself too interested in the other 
        social media apps.

        Activity 2: GCFLearnFree: LinkedIn Basics
        I decided to try one of the basic tutorials for the applications so I can try to better understand an application that I am not so familiar with. I decided to go with 
        LinkedIn because it was a site I never used before and wanted to try it out to see how I would like it. After playing around with it for some time, and seeing how the 
        site runs and how it benefits you, I came with the conclusion that LinkedIn is a very useful website but isn’t for me.
