        Session 4 - Internet Fundamentals - Email
        Activity 1: Send, receive, and respond to email
        I have been using a Google Gmail account for as long as I can remember, so I decided to try a different email provider out for this activity. I decided to go with Yahoo!
        because it is a email provider I have not ever used before, so thought it would be a good idea to try something new. It was very interesting going through the Yahoo! 
        interface since I am not used to it. Sending an email and replying to emails with Yahoo! was cool and liked doing it through a different email provider than I am used 
        too. I do in fact still prefer Google Gmail email provider over any other one.

        Activity 2: Use an email client program
        I decided to try out the email client program for the next activity on this assignment since it is something I have never tried out before. Since it was a program, I 
        have never used before for my email accounts, I thought it would be best to try it out and could even possibly use it for my own email accounts. After downloading and 
        playing around with Mozilla Thunderbird, I came up with the conclusion that this program is very useful, and I love how it keeps all our inboxes in one folder which is 
        all in one spot, it makes it very convenient and quick to use. I recommend people to try this program out, especially if you have multiple email accounts.
