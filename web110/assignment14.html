      Session 14 - SQL
      Summary
      In this weekâ€™s lesson we were learning about SQL's and the role they play in the e-commerce and retail fields. After doing this acitivity you get a sense of how important
      SQL's are. It was very interesting going through the SQL tutorial and seeing the various coding there is, and how specific results you get for what you are searching.
      This is a wonderful tool too have, and I see why so many big companies or websites would use SQL's to better organize their company.

        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers;</li>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers
            WHERE Country='USA';</li>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM Products;</li>
        <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
            VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');</li>
        <li>UPDATE Customers
            SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
            WHERE CustomerID = 1;</li>
