        Session 8 - HTML Assignment Summary
        While completing these HTML activities, I have learned a lot of new information when it comes to HTML coding since I am a beginner in this field. I enjoy learning new 
        information when it pertains to this sort of subject and was a good learning experience getting the chance of learning the basics of HTML coding. I would have to say it 
        was rather fun being able to play around with HTML coding as an assignment for class. I see myself using HTML in the fashion that we have been doing in class since it is 
        a good practice for me and also very fun for me to do as well.
