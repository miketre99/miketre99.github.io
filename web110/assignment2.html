        Session 2 - Internet Fundamentals - Web Browsers
        Activity 1: Practice using web browsers
        Going through the activities, I stumbled upon, “Practice using web browsers,” and decided to try them all out since all I have ever used was Google Chrome. It was 
        different going from Google Chrome to the four other web browsers listed, but it was nice trying something different to experiment with. I really liked the interface 
        of Opera and enjoyed how silk and smooth everything looked and felt while playing around on the browser. Microsoft Edge felt a tad boring and outdated for me, so 
        that’s a no for me. Mozilla Firefox was a nice alternative browser to use and wouldn’t mind using it again. Brave web browser had a nice looking interface, and had high
        hopes for it, but ended up not enjoying it. I’d have to say Google Chrome is still my go-to web browser, but I wouldn’t mind switching to Opera web browser. 
        Activity 2: Configure browser extensions and add-ons
        Another activity that caught my eye while doing the readings was, “Configure browser extensions and add-ons.” This caught my eye because I am very interested in browser 
        extensions and add-ons that make my life easier and is very interesting to play around with ones you haven’t heard of before. It is also fun for me to test this out 
        while trying out new browsers, or finding existing extensions on my current browser, Google Chrome. I would say I use a lot of add-ons frequently to help me enjoy my 
        time more while searching the web, or just having fun customizations.
