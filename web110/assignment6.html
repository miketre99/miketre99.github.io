        Session 6 - Internet Fundamentals - Networking
        Activity 1: Verify Internet connectivity
        This activity appealed to me because I always wanted to learn more about networking, so this was a perfect activity for me to try out. I got to go through the IP address
         settings which was something I never played around with, so this was a good learning experience as well. It was cool going through the command prompt and looking at my 
         IP address, which was something I never done before. This was the perfect activity for me to understand more of the basics of networking and how to navigate through the 
         command prompt.
         
         Activity 2: For this assignment, I decided to do another activity solely based on IP address because it is something I want to be more knowledgeable about. I went 
         through all the steps and the process so I could practice for when I ever come into this situation in the future. It is a good source of knowledge to know this when you 
         ever come to an issue where you cannot connect to your network. Going through the TCP/IP settings taught me a lot of new information that I was looking for to better 
         understand this topic as it is one very appealing to me and seeing myself use in the future.
