        Session 11 - Internet Fundamentals - Web Accessibility
        Activity 1: Mozilla: What is accessbility?
        Web accessibility is a way of making your own websites usable by as many people as possible. We normally think on this topic about people who have disabilities, but this 
        way of making websites more accessible can also benefit other groups of people who tend to be on mobile devices, or people with slower than average network connections. 
        A very beneficial web accessibility for people with disabilities are ATs or assistive technologies, so for example people with visual impairments use screen magnifiers 
        that are either physical or software that has zoom capabilities. Most users are relying on screen readers, which is a software that reads digital text aloud.

        Activity 2: W3C Markup Validation Service
        The W3C Markup Validation Service is a very important and beneficial tool that you need to use when dealing with HTML. It is very easy to make a mistake when you are 
        using HTML, so it is always better to double check your work, and make sure you have the proper coding written down. If you have a mistake, you missed while coding then 
        this is a good tool to use so you can correct your mistake and continue what you need to do with your web page. I personally use the W3C Markup Validation Service every 
        time I am using HTML, so I can make sure that I didnâ€™t make any mistakes!
