        Activity 1: Use anti-malware software
        I thought it would be a good idea to test out the anti-malware activity because I believe it will be beneficial for me to know if my PC has any viruses on it and go 
        through the process of safely removing it. After installing the programs and running tests on my PC to find any malware, it was shown that my PC had a lot of cleaning 
        needed to be done which makes sense considering how it has been running recently. Malware programs in my opinion are very important to have, and anyone with electronics 
        should download anti-malware programs right away.

        Activity 2: Research password managers and multi-factor authentication
        Password managers and multi-factor authentication can be two very useful tools that everyone should look into using. Password managers can come in handy when you have so 
        many different passwords for all the accounts you are using, since it would be bad to use the same password for many accounts incase a data leak happened, so you donâ€™t get 
        hacked into every account you have. I use google password manager since it is connected to your google account, so it is easy to use and very convenient. Multi-factor 
        authentication is one of the most important settings to have turned on for any account you have, it makes it so much harder for someone to be able to hack into your account, 
        even if they have the password.
