        Activity 1: Northwind Database Questions
        In this weekâ€™s lesson we were learning about databases. I really enjoyed working on this activity which made us answer 15 questions based on this Northwind database. It 
        was interesting being able to review the database and what it entailed of. I thought it was cool going through the different tables which all had their own specific 
        information that was very important and showed how well structured and organized databases are. Now I understand a lot more why databases are so important and realize 
        how often we use databases on a daily basis. I enjoyed doing this activity on databases, and ready to do more involving it.
