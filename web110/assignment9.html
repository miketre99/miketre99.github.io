    Assignment 9 - Personal Learning Applications
    My personal learning applications for this lesson on CSS for assignment 9 was mainly going through the links that were provided in the beginning to better understand what 
    was expected from in this assignment. I enjoyed working on this assignment because I learned a new language in CSS that helps me better understand the meaning of it, and how 
    it is implemented in web development. CSS changes the whole dynamic of personalization for web development and gives the web developers free rein to do whatever they can 
    imagine. There is so many different options from you to choose from, that it seems like it is endless.
