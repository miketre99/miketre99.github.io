        Session 5b - Internet Fundamentals - Social Media
        Activity 1: VoIP/ Messaging - GCFLearnFree: Snapchat
        For this activity I thought it was best to try another GCFLearnFree activity and decided to do it about snapchat. I chose snapchat because this social media application 
        has been around since I started middle school so it has been around for the better part of my life but I actually never really used the application. So, I decided this 
        was a great opportunity to see what all the hype is about. After playing around the application for some time, I have come to the conclusion that this application is 
        for me. I have come to this conclusion because I really enjoy the aspect of sending pictures or videos as a message to communicate with friends or you can also 
        communicate through text as well.
