        Final Project - YouTube Link and Summary
       As the semester draws to end, we can congratulate ourselves on a job well done. I can say I learned a lot this semester, ranging from knowing nothing to having a decent
       knowledge on internet and web development. I didn't know anything about coding or how to write out HTML, and now I am able to code basic HTML documents and was able to
       design a website all because of this class. This will help me down the road in the future when I start my career!
