        Activity 1: LinkedIn Profile
        For this weekâ€™s activity I decided to do the LinkedIn profile one because it looks like a very beneficial activity to do for myself. It seems like a good idea to make a 
        LinkedIn profile because I can connect with people who are looking to be in the same career field as me, and can see their views on the career etc. It is also a good way 
        to show off my resume to future employers or future employment options. They would be able to see my previous education and previous jobs and as well as my current skills 
        so they can see how I can be a part of their team.
