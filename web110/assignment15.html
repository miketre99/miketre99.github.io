        For this weeks session, we had to fully plan out how we are going to prepare our final project. I enjoyed learning how to use the GNATT Chart method to better organize
        myself for the project. I believe it is a wonderful idea to plan it out this way because then we are more aware of what needs to  be done on which day we choose to
        complete that portion of the final project. It gives you a better sense of relief when you are able to plan it out this way, and helped me plan out how I want to do my
        final project!
